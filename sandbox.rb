    To Whom This May Concern: 

    You've been kidnapped. Now before you start freaking out, 
    I'm not going to hurt you. But, I'm also not going to let you go 
    so easily. Let's skip all the who, what, where, and why and get 
    down to business.
    You want out, and I want you to play my little game.
    
    As you have undoubtely noticed it is dark. Just the same, you have
    a flashlight. You'll need that flashlight to navigate your way through
    my mansion and find the clues to your escape. Each clue leads you closer
    to a special gold key, which is needed to open the door out of this place.
    But be careful, your flashlight has limited charges, so use it sparingly
    and keep an eye out for more batteries.

    Without further adieu, let's get started. 

    Your first clue is . . . whatâ€™s good for a headache?
